# TODO

## Important

- Remove unneccesary stuff from render pipeline
- Add player movement
- Add grass
- Add cascading shadow maps

## Important but not urgent

- Post about water
- Add sound
- Add clouds
- Only regenerate textures once we're done resizing
- Disable rendering and inputs when unfocused

## Would be cool

- editor: Add object click selection
- editor: Add object axis-aligned moving
- editor: Add scene export

## Probably not worth it

- Add OBB collision resolution
